I felt like I'd end up in a vicious cycle of trying to get somewhere but never being able to mature as an artist.” And so, to move forward and trump 2017’s all-conquering self-titled debut album, she looked back. “I’ve time-traveled quite a lot on this record,” she says of the aptly named <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, which takes in everything from life-affirming disco (“Don’t Start Now,” “Break My Heart”) to ’80s power pop (“Physical”) and even Debbie Harry-indebted raps (“Levitating”). And yet, it never sounds anything other than forward-looking. “It’s a fine line, so I wanted to bring something that was reminiscent of my childhood and at the same time make it really current,” she says. “I remember listening to songs by Moloko and Jamiroquai, which would make you want to dance no matter what time of day it was. I wanted to recreate that feeling.” On <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, the singer also gets personal, delving into heartbreak—and then new love. Despite the innovative new sound—and changes in her personal life, from relationships to overnight megafame (“My friends still treat me the same, I haven’t changed that much as a person”)—her mission to take women with her every time she rises remains intact. “For me, it’s always about championing women and putting ourselves in the position of power,” she says. “I want to show that women are allowed to take risks and try things differently musically. And wear the pants, you know? We don’t have that enough in music.” Here, let Lipa guide you through the thrilling <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, track by track.<br />\n<b>Future Nostalgia</b>\n“I went in the studio to write with [US producer] Jeff Bhasker, and I just felt ready to do something really bold. I told him that the album’s name would be <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, and he just got on his instruments and started playing all these crazy different sounds. It was just about having fun and not taking yourself too seriously. And also, for me, a feeling of empowerment and sassiness. When I put down the lyrics ‘I know you ain’t used to a female alpha,’ I didn’t mean that I was the first. The lyric is about the shoulders of the giants I’ve leant on, and the fact that I’ve been inspired by female alphas who have shown me that we can do it. This felt like the perfect album opener because of the fearlessness.”<br />\n<b>Don’t Start Now</b>\n“Every song on this album had to fit the theme of nostalgia, and this has a fun disco element. Sonically, it’s quite dissimilar to what I’ve put out before, but lyrically it still holds my blueprint. It’s a perfect breakup song, about when you finally find your feet and then somebody decides to come crawling back just when you’ve moved on. It’s an empowering statement about being stronger than you think. I always want to make music in the hope that people can relate to it. When it’s honest and about real subjects and things that have happened, I feel safer.”<br />\n<b>Cool</b>\n“My A&R played me this song two years ago, and I instantly hated it. I was like, ‘Please never play me this again.’ But a year down the line, when I was writing, he sat me down and was like, ‘I have something to play you.’ And he just played the instrumental and I was like, ‘This is actually really good with no lyrics.’ I went into the studio with Tove Lo and just had fun exploring. It has some Prince influences, and it was a range of my voice I hadn’t tried. This whole album was about exploring growth and trying out new things, so I wanted to embrace challenges. We wrote something that felt really real to me, and it’s just a romantic, summery song, about meeting someone who has you losing all your cool.”<br />\n<b>Physical</b>\n“When this comes on, I want people to be like, ‘OK, we’re doing shots.’ This is when the party gets really wild. But I was nervous about this song; I thought it might be a bit Marmite because it’s so relentless and out there and in your face, and then the middle eight just amps it up even more. I didn’t expect people to go as crazy for it as they have, so I’m really grateful for the response. Lyrically, I used words like ‘diamond rich’ which felt quite nostalgic to me, but then added more playfulness to ensure it felt current. It was such a spur-of-the-moment kind of song, which at times had a Eurythmics vibe to it.”<br />\n<b>Levitating</b>\n“This is the first song I wrote where I really felt I had everyone on board with the concept of the album. When I was writing it, I felt like I was in <i>Austin Powers</i> and was like, ‘If I do a video for this, Mike Myers has to be in it.’ It had to be fun and bubbly but with lyrics that felt really smart. This is about me exploring happy songs and doing something that’s not ‘dance crying.’ It’s about having fun and meeting someone and falling in love and thinking, ‘You’ve probably met me at the perfect time, let’s just go for it.’ It’s the feeling when love makes you feel like you’re levitating. It’s otherworldly. Things get quite Daft Punk-y here, but it’s playful, and the middle eight is almost like my British version of Blondie’s rapping. I felt like I needed to get my British side across as well on this record, because sometimes people don't actually know where I’m from.”<br />\n<b>Pretty Please</b>\n\"This is the first moment you really get to take a breather on the record, especially after ‘Levitating,’ which is so full on. It sounds cool and chill, but it’s about the opposite. I like playing with sounds and concepts in that way. The song is about promising someone—or yourself—that you’re going to be really chill in the early stages of the relationship, but then realizing that ‘Yeah, that’s just not me.’ The lyrics that opens it is ‘Somewhere in the middle/I think I lied a little.’ It kind of sums it up.\"<br />\n<b>Hallucinate</b>\n“This is quite different from the other songs on the album, which all tie in together. But I just wanted this to be like a fun ’90s dance track. It felt so freeing. This one’s my festival song. Whenever I make songs, I imagine what they’d be like if I performed them at Glastonbury. I knew there was no way I could do a festival without this song.”<br />\n<b>Love Again</b>\n“A relationship hadn’t worked out for me, and I wrote this when I felt like there was no light. It was a song for me, to give myself a little cuddle, and was about being hopeful that I would fall in love again. We already had these beautiful strings, then [Miami producer and songwriter] Clarence Coffee Jr. had the genius idea of adding in a sample of ‘Your Woman’ by White Town. That really gave the song the push it needed, because we definitely needed a more dancy element. I wrote it at a difficult time, but sometimes songs help you get out of certain situations. It’s like cheap therapy, and I think this is my favorite song on the record.”<br />\n<b>Break My Heart</b>\n“This samples INXS’s ‘Need You Tonight,’ and it’s a perfect explanation of ‘dance crying.’ It’s about finally being in a happy place and knowing this new person is amazing. But then thinking: ‘Nothing else compares to this, and what if this ends and it breaks my heart?’ It’s the whole thing of being scared to be too happy, like when your day is going really well and you think, ‘What’s the one thing that’s going to fuck it up?’ I’m a hopeless romantic and always ask myself: ‘How am I going to protect this?’ But it’s also a sweet and vulnerable place to be, because you also see how much you care. It helped that the people I wrote this with know my boyfriend, which helped me be really open.”<br />\n<b>Good in Bed</b>\n“I wondered about changing the title of this, because it’s quite in your face. I guess this song does what it says on the tin: It’s about when good sex is the only thing that was holding two people together. It was very fun to get to make a song like this and to be so carefree and open. Those relationships never last; it’s a cautionary tale.”<br />\n<b>Boys Will Be Boys</b>\n“I talk so much about female empowerment, but I’d never done a song which really talks about the growing pains of what it’s like to be a woman. I was in the studio with the team I wrote ‘Physical’ with, and was just talking about what it was like to get off the bus from school and walk home, knowing that there'd be boys on bikes around the estates, and that I'd be so fucking shit scared in case they would catcall or chase me home or whatever. For girls at school, there was always that fear of trying to get home before it got too dark. I can't believe that I had to actually put keys through my knuckles, like Wolverine, in case anybody might say something or try to chase or attack me. It’s crazy that we have to think about these things and not feel safe for a three-minute walk down the road from the bus stop to your flat, and I feel we maybe don't educate the boys enough to understand what it's like to be a girl. I just want this song to be a conversation starter. I want it also to just be a little bit of an eye-opener. It’s not a song that's out to offend anyone, or point any fingers. But I wanted the lyrics to be quite cutting for the sake of the conversation, and in the hope that there can be change. It’s also to show solidarity with other girls and be like, ‘I've been through it as well.’ And at the same time, for any young fans or listeners, to be something that maybe they'll ask the older sister or brother about, and to try and understand why I decided to put this in a song. This song is a completely different element, but lyrically it was very important for me to have it on the record.”"},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1734980417","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1734980417","attributes":{"copyright":"Under exclusive license to Warner Records UK, a division of Warner Music UK Limited, ℗ 2024 Radical22 Limited with the exception of Track 2 ℗ 2023 Radical22 Limited","genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"5021732254870","artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/ed/e8/1c/ede81c4b-593d-913a-cfe4-3b12496f67e5/5021732254870.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"034e61","textColor1":"efd0be","textColor2":"e2b7a4","textColor3":"c0b6ac","textColor4":"b5a297"},"playParams":{"id":"1734980417","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/radical-optimism/1734980417","recordLabel":"Warner Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":11,"isSingle":false,"name":"Radical Optimism","artistName":"Dua Lipa","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album and Interview","standard":"When it comes to manifesting, Dua Lipa is, well, radically optimistic about its power. And with good reason. “I know this is going to sound mad, but when I was writing my first album, I was having thoughts about my third album,” she tells Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I thought by the third album, I would maybe be deserving of working with Tame Impala. <i>Currents</i> [Tame Impala’s career-defining 2015 album] was the record that completely shook me.” With <i>Radical Optimism</i>—the follow-up to 2020’s impeccable, superstar-confirming <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, and the next note after her 2023 <i>Barbie</i> smash “Dance the Night”—Lipa got her wish. \n\nThe 11 tracks here were made with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, as well as Tobias Jesso Jr. (the singer-songwriter Adele has labeled her “secret weapon”), OG PC Music artist Danny L Harle (PinkPantheress, Caroline Polachek), and Lipa’s long-term collaborator Caroline Ailin, co-writer of “New Rules.” It’s not the <i>most</i> obvious team for a chart-dominating name like Lipa to recruit, but maybe there was radical optimism in that, too. Plus, the proof came in the first song they wrote together: A moodier sister to <i>Future Nostalgia</i> standout “Hallucinate,” “Illusion” is an indisputable banger that feels tailor-made for Lipa’s 2024 Glastonbury headline set (something else she manifested for her third album). “It was like, ‘OK, how are we all going to connect together in the room? How is it all going to work?’” says Lipa. “[‘Illusion’] really kicked us off. When we wrote that song, it just gave us confidence as a group.” \n\nLike <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, <i>Radical Optimism</i> pulls from the past, so you can expect shimmering synths, groove-laden basslines, nods to psychedelia, and plenty of ’80s production (Lipa has also cited the adventurousness of both Britpop and Massive Attack among the album’s spiritual influences). But the singer-songwriter wanted to “experiment and do something different” as well, and in place of <i>Future Nostalgia</i>’s polished nu-disco, <i>Radical Optimism</i> often embraces an organic, golden-pop feeling with bright acoustic guitars, pianos, roomy drums, handclaps, and the occasional panpipe, plus some skyscraping vocals that should stop anyone describing Lipa’s vocal style as “nonchalant” again (see: “Falling Forever”). All of which is set against Lipa’s most personal writing to date, fueled by reflections on heartbreak, singledom, the arresting experience of meeting someone you might just give your heart to, and realizing the person you once loved has moved on. \n\n“With this album, I feel like I’ve managed to put so much more honesty out there and be really open in a way that I don’t think I’ve ever had the chance to,” she says. “It was a beautiful experience to not be afraid.” That was helped, again, by the team around her. “You come into the room, you’re hanging out with your friends, and you’re just having a tell-all,” she says. “There was absolutely no holds barred. They knew everything that was happening. There was no judgment. The fact that everyone felt free to just be themselves is what, I think, created such a beautiful energy in the room.” \n\nThe singer-songwriter <i>gets</i> heartbreak pop; after all, she’s made a whole career out of crafting sharp, post-breakup empowerment anthems (and you’ll hear her trademark up-front lyricism here, such as on “Training Season,” in which she declares, “Are you somebody who can go there?/’Cause I don’t wanna have to show ya”). But here, Lipa also favors acceptance and a heartening sense of hope. Perhaps the album’s most powerful moment comes at its end, when Lipa realizes her ex has moved on and experiences an unfamiliar feeling: just happiness that they’re happy. “It feels like a full 180,” she says of closing track “Happy for You,” a song she admits she couldn’t have written until this point in her career. “Maturing, seeing almost my ghost on the other side and being like, ‘Wow, you’ve grown so much from an experience to be able to see things from that perspective. You have to be in the act of forgiveness and growing and learning and being OK with the past in order to move on. For me, ‘Happy for You’ is a beautiful, happy song because it’s so reflective of my journey.” You might say the same about “Maria,” in which Lipa salutes a new partner’s ex for making them who they are today. “I’m better, too, from the ones that I’ve lost/Now he is everything I’d ever want,” she sings. “I wanna thank you for all that you’ve done.” \n\nWorking through these stories has been “a form of therapy” for Lipa, but she always kept two things in mind: what her songs mean to other people and how they might land at Glastonbury, which the singer-songwriter calls “the pinnacle.” “I think about emotions and feelings and thoughts. How does this make me feel? How will this make someone else feel when they hear it? What is the energy and the emotion and the thing that I’m trying to convey at this point in my life?” For Lipa, the answer seems to be in this album’s title. “What [this album] was really about was the theme, which was ‘radical optimism,’” she says. “It’s this idea of rolling with the punches, of not letting anything get you down for too long. I’ve always seen the positive side of things, of being able to grow and move forward and change your perspective regardless of what’s happening in your life—whether it’s heartbreak, whether it’s a friendship, whether it’s a relationship, whether it’s just growing and seeing things differently. I think it’s a big part of maturing.”\n\nWhen <i>Future Nostalgia</i> came out in 2020, just as the global pandemic set in, the album met the moment in a way Lipa could never have foreseen. It became a vehicle for escapism—another kind of radical optimism in a locked-down world. It seems that, for Lipa, <i>Radical Optimism</i> was about meeting <i>her</i> moment—the point she began working with the collaborators she’d always dreamed of, on songs made to perform on the most important stage she can think of. And now, she can draw a line under everything she needed this album to help heal. “Now, I’m done. This chapter is done,” she says. “I did so much growing. I feel like that is my exorcism.”","short":"“It was a beautiful experience.” Dua on the album she dreamed into existence."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1740719603","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1740719603","attributes":{"copyright":"Under exclusive license to Warner Records UK, a division of Warner Music UK Limited, ℗ 2024 Radical22 Limited","genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-04-11","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"5021732272546","artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/39/93/13/3993137c-245e-3522-9277-44755be1577c/5021732272546.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"170d14","textColor1":"f0e5ed","textColor2":"e8ab9d","textColor3":"c4bac2","textColor4":"be8b82"},"playParams":{"id":"1740719603","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/illusion-extended-instrumental-single/1740719603","recordLabel":"Warner Records","trackCount":1,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":true,"name":"Illusion (Extended Instrumental) - Single","artistName":"Dua Lipa","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1228739599","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1228739599","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2017 Dua Lipa Limited under exclusive license to Warner Music UK Limited.

But her breakout smash, “New Rules,” was preceded by <i>seven singles</i> and her debut album was twice delayed, arriving several months after originally planned. Even then, <i>Dua Lipa</i> was something of a sleeper hit, reaching its UK chart peak 38 weeks after release. \n\nWhile her debut LP’s rollout may have been shaky, Lipa herself has never appeared anything less than assured, with a vocal style so cool it borders on aloof. Her rich, sultry stylings here anchor a collection that isn’t afraid to genre-hop, brooding over the tropical pop of “Hotter than Hell” as it boils to its euphoric climax. “Be the One” is similarly summery, with a persistent chorus that drips yearning over a Europop beat—evoking all the wistfulness of a holiday romance—and even “Thinking ’Bout You” morphs from a laidback acoustic jam into something more full-throated. The pace only slows on the closing track “Homesick,” a piano ballad co-written with Chris Martin about those you leave behind when your pop-star dreams come true. \n\nMNEK co-write “IDGAF” lambasts a good-for-nothing-ex over a military drum line (“You say you’re sorry/But it’s too late now/So save it, get gone, shut up”) and definitively establishes that Dua knows her way around an anthemic chorus. In that regard, it’s a perfect companion track to the album’s centerpiece “New Rules.” Over a shimmering tropical beat, Dua dispenses breakup wisdom with the firm hand of a no-nonsense agony aunt (“One: Don’t pick up the phone/You know he’s only callin’ ’cause he’s drunk and alone”). It effortlessly marks the precise moment of her rise to the upper echelons of the pop stratosphere.

The British pop star released her third album <i>Radical Optimism</i>—on which she realized her long-held dream of working with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker—and headlined Glastonbury Festival, something else she’d been “manifesting” since the start of her career. Then, in October, she ticked off another major moment: this performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall. Here, alongside the 53-piece Heritage Orchestra, conducted by Ben Foster, and a 14-person-strong choir, Lipa performs <i>Radical Optimism</i> start to finish, followed by some of her best moments—from “Be the One” and her 2023 <i>Barbie</i> smash “Dance the Night” to <i>Future Nostalgia</i>’s excellent “Love Again” (its “My Woman” sample performed by horns) and “Levitating.” Plus, there’s a Cleo Sol cover (“Sunshine”) and an appearance from actual Elton John, who joins her on stage for their 2021 megahit “Cold Heart.” \n\n<i>Radical Optimism</i> was an album of golden, breezy, and psychedelia-inspired pop, yet here, its songs take on a grand, cinematic quality, with an almost Bond-theme edge to “Houdini” or “Training Season.” As the album’s songs are bolstered with strings and horns, Lipa delivers performances both towering (on the galloping earworm “Falling Forever,” for example) and intimate, as on the stripped-back “Anything for Love.” Then Lipa switches gear, intent on getting the party started (and it works; just listen to the crowd reaction as “Dance the Night” opens, complete with live disco strings). By the time Lipa ends her set with “Don’t Start Now,” accompanied by the choir <i>and</i> an audience sing-along, this Royal Albert Hall performance feels like a joyous celebration for a British pop star who spent 2024 achieving her dreams. “An unforgettable night” indeed, as Lipa puts it herself as this show closes out.","short":"Hear Dua cap off a milestone year live from the Royal Albert Hall."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1523100098","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1523100098","attributes":{"copyright":"Universal Music Latino/ NEON16; ℗ 2020 Sueños Globales, LLC, Exclusively Licensed To UMG Recordings Inc.","genreNames":["Urbano latino","Music","Latin"],"releaseDate":"2020-07-23","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602507245955","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/c7/93/50/c793507d-c4df-4c05-80bb-3a02d9f95113/20UMGIM38540.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"1e1c3b","textColor1":"faccda","textColor2":"89a5ec","textColor3":"cea9ba","textColor4":"7489c8"},"playParams":{"id":"1523100098","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/un-dia-one-day-single/1523100098","recordLabel":"Sueños Globales, LLC","trackCount":1,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":true,"name":"UN DIA (ONE DAY) - Single","artistName":"J Balvin, Dua Lipa, Bad Bunny & Tainy","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1820945773","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1820945773","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2019 Dua Lipa Limited under exclusive license to Warner Records UK, a division of Warner Music UK Limited","genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2020-01-10","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"190295283841","artwork":{"width":4000,"height":4000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/bf/15/50/bf155022-d770-f703-5065-be3eec53ae46/190295283841.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"f6eb7f","textColor1":"0c0b06","textColor2":"2b291a","textColor3":"3a381e","textColor4":"54502e"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dont-start-now-remixes-single/1820945773","playParams":{"id":"1820945773","kind":"album"},"recordLabel":"Warner Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":6,"isSingle":false,"name":"Don't Start Now (Remixes) - Single","artistName":"Dua Lipa","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1196786247","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1196786247","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2016 STMPD RCRDS B.V. exclusively licensed to Epic Amsterdam, a divison of Sony Music Entertainment Netherlands B.V.","genreNames":["Dance","Music"],"releaseDate":"2017-01-27","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"886446328331","artwork":{"width":1500,"height":1500,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/44/46/1f/44461f0c-a949-ce72-0164-704056469fc8/886446328331.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"d0c7c0","textColor1":"0e0d0e","textColor2":"1b201d","textColor3":"353232","textColor4":"3f413e"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/scared-to-be-lonely-single/1196786247","playParams":{"id":"1196786247","kind":"album"},"recordLabel":"Epic Amsterdam","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":1,"isSingle":true,"name":"Scared To Be Lonely - Single","artistName":"Martin Garrix & Dua Lipa","editorialNotes":{"short":"Lipa’s beautiful vocal is matched by Garrix’s sublime production."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1434745598","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1434745598","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2018 SILK CITY IP, LLC.

Next, she swapped her previous albums’ covers for enigmatic, kaleidoscopic new images on streaming services. Then, there was the all-important haircut reveal on Instagram (caption: “miss me?”). The signs were all pointing to one thing: Three years after 2020’s <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, Dua Lipa was readying herself for her comeback. \n\nNow, the British pop superstar has unveiled “Houdini.” And after the euphoric, disco-indebted anthems of <i>Future Nostalgia</i>, it finds her exploring a new definition of that album’s now-meets-then concept. Expect shimmering ’80s synths, a chugging bassline, 303s recalling Daft Punk’s biggest hits, and Lipa’s ice-cold vocals, as she paints herself as a modern-day escape artist: “Catch me or I go Houdini.” \n\n“‘Houdini’ embodies the energy of a good night out,” Lipa tells Apple Music. “This was the first track I wrote about that fun and freeing time of being single.” But alongside the song’s flirty lyricism, there’s also the empowerment that’s become central to all of Lipa’s music. “The lyrics are a bit cheeky, but there is a real underlying message of understanding yourself deeply and having no guilt about knowing your self-worth. Sometimes you just have to pull a Houdini and leave a situation that’s no longer serving you.” \n\nArriving three years after <i>Future Nostalgia</i> confirmed Lipa’s place at pop’s top table—and after this summer’s inescapable “Dance the Night”—the track’s lyrics also hint that Lipa is more than aware that we’ve been waiting for her comeback. “I come and I go/Tell me all the ways you need me,” she sings. “I’m not here for long/Catch me or I go Houdini.”","short":"Dua is back!

After her 2017 self-titled debut established her as an outspoken, effortlessly cool face of pop’s future on airy tracks like “New Rules,” 2020’s <i>Future Nostalgia</i> and its funky calling card “Don’t Start Now” provided a uniting force of positivity at the dawn of global lockdowns. Her nonchalant confidence has made her a versatile collaborator with everyone from DJ superstar Calvin Harris (2018’s “One Kiss”) to reggaetón royalty J Balvin (2021’s “UN DIA [ONE DAY]”), and 2023’s <i>Barbie</i>-inspired hit “Dance the Night” built naturally upon her savvy disco revisionism. By the time of 2024’s <i>Radical Optimism</i>, Lipa had her absolute pick of creative partners—and she chose Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker.
