There were whispers that Compton’s finest was working on an album in the wake of his feud with Drake, a once-in-a-generation beef that kept jaws dropped for months. (Perhaps you’ve heard of a little song called “Not Like Us,” an immediate entry into the canon of all-time great diss tracks.) After a sold-out celebration at the Kia Forum, an armful of Grammy nods and streaming records, and the headlining slot at next year’s Super Bowl, Lamar ties up his biggest year yet with a bow with his sixth album, <i>GNX</i>, the most legitimately surprising surprise drop since <i>BEYONCÉ</i> in 2013.\n\nNamed for his beloved classic Buick, <i>GNX</i> finds Kendrick wielding a hatchet he’s by no means ready to bury, still channeling this summer’s cranked-to-11 energy. On “wacced out murals,” he’s riding around listening to Anita Baker, plotting on several downfalls: “It used to be fuck that n***a, but now it’s plural/Fuck everybody, that’s on my body.” (Yes, there’s a nod to his Super Bowl drama with Lil Wayne.) If you’ve been holding your breath for Jack Antonoff to link with Mustard, wait no more—the seemingly odd couple share production credits on multiple tracks, the explosive “tv off” among them.\n\nStill, K.Dot keeps you guessing: It’s not quite 12 tracks of straight venom over world-conquering West Coast beats. SZA helps cool things down on the Luther Vandross-sampling “luther,” while Lamar snatches back a borrowed title on “heart pt. 6” to remember the early days of TDE: “Grinding with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us/Bless our hearts.” He cycles through past lives over a flip of 2Pac’s “Made N****z” on “reincarnated” before getting real with his father about war, peace, addiction, and ego death, and on “man at the garden,” he outlines his qualifications for the position of GOAT. Here’s another bullet point to add to that CV: On <i>GNX</i>, Lamar still surprises while giving the people exactly what they want.\n","short":"He asked us to “watch the party die,” but only so he could resurrect it."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1440818890","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440818890","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2013 Aftermath/Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Gangsta Rap","Rap","Hardcore Rap","West Coast Rap"],"releaseDate":"2012-10-22","upc":"00602537362769","isMasteredForItunes":true,"artwork":{"width":1426,"height":1426,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/ca/5b/c0/ca5bc0b3-d81d-cc6c-0d19-54b9eedb6dbd/12UMGIM52990.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"ececec","textColor1":"100e16","textColor2":"132a36","textColor3":"3c3b41","textColor4":"3e515a"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/good-kid-m-a-a-d-city-deluxe-version/1440818890","playParams":{"id":"1440818890","kind":"album"},"recordLabel":"Aftermath","trackCount":18,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":false,"name":"good kid, m.A.A.d city (Deluxe Version)","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Featured in 100 Best Albums","standard":"<b>100 Best Albums</b> A few days after releasing 2012’s <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, the then-25-year-old Kendrick Lamar deemed his sophomore studio album “classic-worthy.” He wasn’t lying: Lamar’s sophomore album is one of the defining hip-hop records of the 21st century. On the surface, <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> is a hood tragedy, with Lamar painting a vivid picture of Black and brown youths growing up in underserved communities. But the album is also powered by faith and hope, with Lamar chronicling his turbulent coming-of-age through a cast of compelling characters that portray the trauma, familial guidance, and relationships that led to his inevitable ascent. \n\nWest Coast hip-hop elders like Snoop and Dre anointed Lamar to carry on the legacy of gangsta rap, and his second studio album—conceptual enough to be a rock opera—certainly uplifts the genre with its near-biblical themes: religion vs. violence and monogamy vs. lust. \n\nSitting just a few miles from Compton, where much of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> takes place, Lamar pieced together tracks alongside collaborators Sounwave and Dave Free, both of whom had known the prolific rapper since high school. Throughout the writing process, Lamar would frequently return to his childhood neighborhood to relive the “mental space” he was in during the early days of his rap career, unearthing the deeply personal tales that came to shape the monumental artist.\n\nFrom the album’s opening scene—a collective prayer of gratitude—Lamar’s approach is entirely theatric (he even gives <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i> a subtitle: “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”). And he never misses an opportunity to hold listeners in his grip, unspooling a series of vulnerable confessions over the album’s 12 tracks. Graphic scenes of violence, addiction, and disillusionment are pervasive here. But Lamar makes even the harshest truths easy to swallow, as he does on “Swimming Pools (Drank),” a vivid tale of alcoholism. <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>’s legacy is a crucial example of American storytelling that established the future Pulitzer Prize winner as perhaps his generation’s most accomplished writer.","short":"Hip-hop storytelling at its most visceral and vivid."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1744776162","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744776162","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2024 Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-05-04","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602465779967","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/d0/ef/b6/d0efb685-73be-fdee-58c9-be655f4cd4fd/24UMGIM51924.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"475260","textColor1":"e3e4e9","textColor2":"c2cfe8","textColor3":"c3c7ce","textColor4":"a9b6cc"},"playParams":{"id":"1744776162","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/not-like-us-single/1744776162","recordLabel":"Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":1,"isSingle":true,"name":"Not Like Us - Single","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1623854804","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1623854804","attributes":{"copyright":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records; ℗ 2022 Aftermath/Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2022-05-13","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602445969333","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music116/v4/72/a1/a9/72a1a9a0-6c42-a37f-aad4-7e8772365c6d/22UMGIM52376.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"1a1d14","textColor1":"dcb388","textColor2":"d0ae85","textColor3":"b59570","textColor4":"ac916e"},"playParams":{"id":"1623854804","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mr-morale-the-big-steppers/1623854804","recordLabel":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records","trackCount":18,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":false,"name":"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"King Kendrick’s two-part masterwork: Hear it in Spatial Audio.","standard":"When Kendrick Lamar popped up on two tracks from Baby Keem’s <i>The Melodic Blue</i> (“range brothers” and “family ties”), it felt like one of hip-hop’s prophets had descended a mountain to deliver scripture.

But if the Compton MC is broadcasting anything across his fifth proper album <i>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</i>, it’s that he’s only human.\n\nThe project is split into two parts, each comprising nine songs, all of which serve to illuminate Lamar’s continually evolving worldview. Central to Lamar’s thesis is accountability. The MC has painstakingly itemized his shortcomings, assessing his relationships with money (“United in Grief”), white women (“Worldwide Steppers”), his father (“Father Time”), the limits of his loyalty (“Rich Spirit”), love in the context of heteronormative relationships (“We Cry Together,” “Purple Hearts”), motivation (“Count Me Out”), responsibility (“Crown”), gender (“Auntie Diaries”), and generational trauma (“Mother I Sober”). It’s a dense and heavy listen. But just as sure as Kendrick Lamar is human like the rest of us, he’s also a Pulitzer Prize winner, one of the most thoughtful MCs alive, and someone whose honesty across <I>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers</I> could help us understand why any of us are the way we are."},"isComplete":false}},{"id":"1440881047","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440881047","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2017 Aftermath/Interscope (Top Dawg Entertainment)","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","Rap","West Coast Rap"],"releaseDate":"2017-04-14","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"00602557608717","artwork":{"width":6000,"height":6000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music112/v4/86/c9/bb/86c9bb30-fe3d-442e-33c1-c106c4d23705/17UMGIM88776.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"ebe7e8","textColor1":"24191d","textColor2":"341e27","textColor3":"4c4245","textColor4":"58464e"},"playParams":{"id":"1440881047","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/damn/1440881047","recordLabel":"Aftermath","trackCount":14,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":false,"name":"DAMN.","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"Lamar’s fourth LP is a brilliant, brutally honest masterpiece.","standard":"In the two years since <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, we’ve hung on Kendrick Lamar's every word—whether he’s destroying rivals on a cameo, performing the #blacklivesmatter anthem <i>on top of a police car</i> at the BET Awards, or hanging out with Obama.

His 2015 follow-up, <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, served as a raised-fist rebuke to anyone who thought they had this Compton-born rapper figured out. Intertwining Afrocentric and Afrofuturist motifs with poetically personal themes and jazz-funk aesthetics, <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> expands beyond the gangsta rap preconceptions foisted upon Lamar’s earlier works.\n\nEven from the album’s first few seconds—which feature the sound of crackling vinyl and a faded Boris Gardiner soul sample—it’s clear <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> operates on an altogether different cosmic plane than its decidedly more commercial predecessor. The album’s Flying Lotus-produced opening track, “Wesley’s Theory,” includes a spoken-word invocation from musician Josef Leimberg and an appearance by Parliament-Funkadelic legend George Clinton—names that give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> added atomic weight. Yet Lamar’s lustful and fantastical verses, which are as audacious as the squirmy Thundercat basslines underneath, never get lost in an album packed with huge names. Throughout <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, Lamar goes beyond hip-hop success tropes: On “King Kunta,” he explores his newfound fame, alternating between anxiety and big-stepping braggadocio. On “The Blacker the Berry,” meanwhile, Lamar pointedly explores and expounds upon identity and racial dynamics, all the while reaching for a reckoning. And while “Alright” would become one of the rapper’s best-known tracks, it’s couched in harsh realities, and features an anthemic refrain delivered in a knowing, weary rasp that belies Lamar’s young age. He’s only 27, and yet he’s already seen too much.\n\nThe cast assembled for this massive effort demonstrates not only Lamar’s reach, but also his vast vision. Producers Terrace Martin and Sounwave, both veterans of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, are among the many names to work behind-the-boards here. But the album also includes turns from everyone from Snoop Dogg to SZA to Ambrose Akinmusire to Kamasi Washington—an intergenerational reunion of a musical diaspora. Their contributions—as well as the contributions of more than a dozen other players—give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> a remarkable range: The contemplations of “Institutionalized” benefit greatly from guest vocalists Bilal and Anna Wise, as do the hood parables of “How Much A Dollar Cost,” which features James Fauntleroy and Ronald Isley. Meanwhile, Robert Glasper’s frenetic piano on “For Free? (Interlude)” and Pete Rock’s nimble scratches on “Complexion (A Zulu Love)” give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> added energy."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1440907513","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440907513","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2017 Aftermath/Interscope (Top Dawg Entertainment)","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music","West Coast Rap","Rap"],"releaseDate":"2017-04-14","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"00602567261216","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/94/28/36/94283609-93bb-db1c-e997-44e82c157e90/00602567261216.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"4f4f4f","textColor1":"fdfdfd","textColor2":"e1e1e1","textColor3":"dadada","textColor4":"c4c4c4"},"playParams":{"id":"1440907513","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/damn-collectors-edition/1440907513","recordLabel":"Aftermath","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":14,"isSingle":false,"name":"DAMN.

Los Angeles’ old guard of gangsta rap greats was waning; the hottest trend in L.A. rap around the time Lamar was forming his Black Hippy super-group (alongside Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q) was the jerkin’ movement, a fun but frivolous dance craze. Los Angeles hip-hop needed a new hero, and Lamar stepped up to the plate. <br />\nBut <I>Section.80</I> was far from a bid for mainstream attention. Over jazzy beats suited for contemplative spells, Lamar raps like he’s searching, bar by bar, for answers to America’s biggest questions, turning a critical eye on his own reality and the systems that reinforce it. The title itself combines Section 8 housing, the low-income developments in which Lamar was raised, with the decade of Lamar’s birth; he thus fashioned himself an ambassador for a generation raised under Ronald Reagan and the crack epidemic. “You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the ’80s,” Lamar spits on lead single “A.D.H.D.,” a generational study as sharp as it is catchy. Ultimately, though, <I>Section.80</I> channels that unrest into a quest for enlightenment; on the knocking “HiiiPower,” Lamar conjures visions of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. and urges listeners to “build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs.” Upon the album's release, some listeners thought this stuff was too radical for Lamar to ever fully break into the mainstream; but the maverick was on the threshold of something even bigger."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1744024729","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744024729","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2024 Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-04-30","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602465761658","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/c5/f5/d8/c5f5d812-ee54-9534-1e4c-bd78877d87ad/24UMGIM50373.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"fafafa","textColor1":"09090b","textColor2":"323232","textColor3":"39393b","textColor4":"5a5a5a"},"playParams":{"id":"1744024729","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/euphoria-single/1744024729","recordLabel":"Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":1,"isSingle":true,"name":"euphoria - Single","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1626195790","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1626195790","attributes":{"copyright":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records; ℗ 2022 Aftermath/Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2022-05-13","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602448038692","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/f6/65/b5/f665b52b-8d6d-b94d-cc2c-db826e35304e/22UMGIM52376.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"1a1d14","textColor1":"dcb388","textColor2":"d0ae85","textColor3":"b59570","textColor4":"ac916e"},"playParams":{"id":"1626195790","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/mr-morale-the-big-steppers/1626195790","recordLabel":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":19,"isSingle":false,"name":"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","editorialNotes":{"short":"Hear Kendrick's two-part masterwork, now with “The Heart Part 5,” in Spatial.","standard":"When Kendrick Lamar popped up on two tracks from Baby Keem’s <i>The Melodic Blue</i> (“range brothers” and “family ties”), it felt like one of hip-hop’s prophets had descended a mountain to deliver scripture.

On the surface, <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> is a hood tragedy, with Lamar painting a vivid picture of Black and brown youths growing up in underserved communities. But the album is also powered by faith and hope, with Lamar chronicling his turbulent coming-of-age through a cast of compelling characters that portray the trauma, familial guidance, and relationships that led to his inevitable ascent.\n\nAfter the release of his 2011 studio debut, <i>Section.80</i>, Lamar had landed a splashy deal with Interscope Records and Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment. Despite his newfound access to state-of-the-art recording spaces and high-profile producers, the rapper opted to return to his roots for <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i>, spending time at the Carson home studio of Top Dawg Entertainment, where he wrote and recorded his debut set. Sitting just a few miles from Compton, where much of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> takes place, Lamar pieced together tracks alongside collaborators Sounwave and Dave Free, both of whom have known the prolific rapper since high school. Throughout the writing process, Lamar would frequently return to his childhood neighborhood to relive the “mental space” he was in during the early days of his rap career, unearthing the deeply personal tales that came to shape the monumental artist.\n\nFrom the album’s opening scene—a collective prayer of gratitude—Lamar’s approach is entirely theatric (he even gives <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> a subtitle: “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”). And he never misses an opportunity to hold listeners in his grip, unspooling a series of vulnerable confessions over the album’s 12 tracks. Graphic scenes of violence, addiction, and disillusionment are pervasive here. But Lamar makes even the harshest truths easy to swallow.

His 2015 follow-up, <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, served as a raised-fist rebuke to anyone who thought they had this Compton-born rapper figured out. Intertwining Afrocentric and Afrofuturist motifs with poetically personal themes and jazz-funk aesthetics, <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i> expands beyond the gangsta rap preconceptions foisted upon Lamar’s earlier works.\n\nEven from the album’s first few seconds—which feature the sound of crackling vinyl and a faded Boris Gardiner soul sample—it’s clear <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> operates on an altogether different cosmic plane than its decidedly more commercial predecessor. The album’s Flying Lotus-produced opening track, “Wesley’s Theory,” includes a spoken-word invocation from musician Josef Leimberg and an appearance by Parliament-Funkadelic legend George Clinton—names that give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> added atomic weight. Yet Lamar’s lustful and fantastical verses, which are as audacious as the squirmy Thundercat basslines underneath, never get lost in an album packed with huge names. Throughout <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, Lamar goes beyond hip-hop success tropes: On “King Kunta,” he explores his newfound fame, alternating between anxiety and big-stepping braggadocio. On “The Blacker the Berry,” meanwhile, Lamar pointedly explores and expounds upon identity and racial dynamics, all the while reaching for a reckoning. And while “Alright” would become one of the rapper’s best-known tracks, it’s couched in harsh realities, and features an anthemic refrain delivered in a knowing, weary rasp that belies Lamar’s young age. He’s only 27, and yet he’s already seen too much.\n\nThe cast assembled for this massive effort demonstrates not only Lamar’s reach, but also his vast vision. Producers Terrace Martin and Sounwave, both veterans of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, are among the many names to work behind-the-boards here. But the album also includes turns from everyone from Snoop Dogg to SZA to Ambrose Akinmusire to Kamasi Washington—an intergenerational reunion of a musical diaspora. Their contributions—as well as the contributions of more than a dozen other players—give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> a remarkable range: The contemplations of “Institutionalized” benefit greatly from guest vocalists Bilal and Anna Wise, as do the hood parables of “How Much A Dollar Cost,” which features James Fauntleroy and Ronald Isley. Meanwhile, Robert Glasper’s frenetic piano on “For Free? (Interlude)” and Pete Rock’s nimble scratches on “Complexion (A Zulu Love)” give <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> added energy."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1781316864","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1781316864","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2024 pgLang, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-11-21","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602475654940","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/54/28/14/54281424-eece-0935-299d-fdd2ab403f92/24UM1IM28978.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"a4a2a3","textColor1":"0c0e0f","textColor2":"1c1e1f","textColor3":"2a2b2d","textColor4":"373839"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/gnx/1781316864","playParams":{"id":"1781316864","kind":"album"},"recordLabel":"pgLang, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","trackCount":12,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":false,"name":"GNX","contentRating":"clean","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"New Album","standard":"If there were any remaining doubts as to hip-hop’s MVP, consider the decision stamped: Kendrick Lamar officially won 2024. There were whispers that Compton’s finest was working on an album in the wake of his feud with Drake, a once-in-a-generation beef that kept jaws dropped for months. (Perhaps you’ve heard of a little song called “Not Like Us,” an immediate entry into the canon of all-time great diss tracks.) After a sold-out celebration at the Kia Forum, an armful of Grammy nods and streaming records, and the headlining slot at next year’s Super Bowl, Lamar ties up his biggest year yet with a bow with his sixth album, <i>GNX</i>, the most legitimately surprising surprise drop since <i>BEYONCÉ</i> in 2013.\n\nNamed for his beloved classic Buick, <i>GNX</i> finds Kendrick wielding a hatchet he’s by no means ready to bury, still channeling this summer’s cranked-to-11 energy. On “wacced out murals,” he’s riding around listening to Anita Baker, plotting on several downfalls: “It used to be fuck that n***a, but now it’s plural/Fuck everybody, that’s on my body.” (Yes, there’s a nod to his Super Bowl drama with Lil Wayne.) If you’ve been holding your breath for Jack Antonoff to link with Mustard, wait no more—the seemingly odd couple share production credits on multiple tracks, the explosive “tv off” among them.\n\nStill, K.Dot keeps you guessing: It’s not quite 12 tracks of straight venom over world-conquering West Coast beats. SZA helps cool things down on the Luther Vandross-sampling “luther,” while Lamar snatches back a borrowed title on “heart pt. 6” to remember the early days of TDE: “Grinding with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us/Bless our hearts.” He cycles through past lives over a flip of 2Pac’s “Made N****z” on “reincarnated” before getting real with his father about war, peace, addiction, and ego death, and on “man at the garden,” he outlines his qualifications for the position of GOAT. Here’s another bullet point to add to that CV: On <i>GNX</i>, Lamar still surprises while giving the people exactly what they want.\n","short":"He asked us to “watch the party die,” but only so he could resurrect it."},"isComplete":true}},{"id":"1744776349","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1744776349","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2024 Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2024-05-03","upc":"00602465779950","isMasteredForItunes":true,"artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music221/v4/eb/a8/5f/eba85f8e-4b9f-72d5-02cb-70818f029d78/24UMGIM51923.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"020403","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c2c2c2","textColor4":"b8b8b8"},"playParams":{"id":"1744776349","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/meet-the-grahams-single/1744776349","recordLabel":"Kendrick Lamar, under exclusive license to Interscope Records","trackCount":1,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":true,"name":"meet the grahams - Single","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","contentRating":"explicit","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1623071775","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1623071775","attributes":{"copyright":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records; ℗ 2022 Aftermath/Interscope Records","genreNames":["Hip-Hop/Rap","Music"],"releaseDate":"2022-05-08","isMasteredForItunes":true,"upc":"00602445936168","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/49/5a/65/495a65d4-8809-ff36-9684-04353a67a9ee/22UMGIM50740.rgb.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"232323","textColor1":"fffdff","textColor2":"c9c1c7","textColor3":"d2d1d2","textColor4":"a7a1a6"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-heart-part-5-single/1623071775","playParams":{"id":"1623071775","kind":"album"},"recordLabel":"pgLang/Top Dawg Entertainment/Aftermath/Interscope Records","trackCount":1,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":true,"name":"The Heart Part 5 - Single","contentRating":"explicit","artistName":"Kendrick Lamar","isComplete":true}},{"id":"1688801938","type":"albums","href":"/v1/catalog/us/albums/1688801938","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2023 Parkwood Entertainment LLC, under exclusive license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment","genreNames":["Pop","Music"],"releaseDate":"2023-05-19","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"196871157186","artwork":{"width":3000,"height":3000,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music126/v4/f3/2b/52/f32b5236-214c-ce40-6772-1a138bf7b493/196871157186.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"e7f2e8","textColor2":"dedfce","textColor3":"b9c1ba","textColor4":"b1b2a5"},"playParams":{"id":"1688801938","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/america-has-a-problem-feat-kendrick-lamar-single/1688801938","recordLabel":"Parkwood Entertainment/Columbia","trackCount":1,"isCompilation":false,"isSingle":true,"name":"AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM (feat.

On the surface, <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> is a hood tragedy, with Lamar painting a vivid picture of Black and brown youths growing up in underserved communities. But the album is also powered by faith and hope, with Lamar chronicling his turbulent coming-of-age through a cast of compelling characters that portray the trauma, familial guidance, and relationships that led to his inevitable ascent.\n\nAfter the release of his 2011 studio debut, <i>Section.80</i>, Lamar had landed a splashy deal with Interscope Records and Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment. Despite his newfound access to state-of-the-art recording spaces and high-profile producers, the rapper opted to return to his roots for <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i>, spending time at the Carson home studio of Top Dawg Entertainment, where he wrote and recorded his debut set. Sitting just a few miles from Compton, where much of <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> takes place, Lamar pieced together tracks alongside collaborators Sounwave and Dave Free, both of whom have known the prolific rapper since high school. Throughout the writing process, Lamar would frequently return to his childhood neighborhood to relive the “mental space” he was in during the early days of his rap career, unearthing the deeply personal tales that came to shape the monumental artist.\n\nFrom the album’s opening scene—a collective prayer of gratitude—Lamar’s approach is entirely theatric (he even gives <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> a subtitle: “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”). And he never misses an opportunity to hold listeners in his grip, unspooling a series of vulnerable confessions over the album’s 12 tracks. Graphic scenes of violence, addiction, and disillusionment are pervasive here. But Lamar makes even the harshest truths easy to swallow. Case in point: “Swimming Pools (Drank),” a sobering tale of alcoholism that became a radio hit and earned a Grammy nomination. It’s just one of several beloved singles on <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i>, which also includes such hits as “Backseat Freestyle,” “Poetic Justice,” and “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.”\n\nWhile <i>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</i> famously lost Best Rap Album to Macklemore at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, its legacy as a crucial example of American storytelling remains intact—and the album established Lamar as perhaps his generation’s most accomplished writer.

Most people heard K-Dot for the first time on 2012’s <i>good kid, m.A.A.d city</i>, a coming-of-age concept album that nonetheless yielded multi-platinum hits like “Swimming Pools (Drank)” and “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe,” seven Grammy nominations and the no. 7 slot on Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums list. That resounding success emboldened the generational MC to explore live-band hybrids of jazz and funk on 2015’s <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i>, all while still producing a single as accessible yet self-possessed as “King Kunta.” As for 2017’s <i>DAMN.</i>, it’s no accident that the song titles are in all caps with a full stop, from the all-time clapback “HUMBLE.” to the slow-burn Rihanna collab “LOYALTY.”\n\nWith Lamar now firmly established in the culture, he was tapped to curate the soundtrack album for 2018’s <i>Black Panther</i>, giving him one of his signature tracks in “All the Stars,” a swooning pop crossover featuring his repeated creative partner SZA. He has remained dominant since then, flexing hard across multiple vocal modes on 2022’s scathing “N95” as if in training for his chart-topping 2024 diss track “Not Like Us,” powered by his ultra-public feud with one-time collaborator Drake. The same year’s “squabble up” and “tv off” reinforced both his fiery focus and talent for polyphonic delivery, slipping between voices as often as needed to hammer home his commentary on hip-hop and
